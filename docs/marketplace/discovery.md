# Capability Discovery

Discovery uses concentric rings to minimize bandwidth while ensuring nodes can find the capabilities they need. Most needs are satisfied locally — physically close nodes are cheapest and fastest.

## Discovery Rings

### Ring 0 — Direct Neighbors

```
Scope: Nodes directly connected via any transport
Update frequency: Every gossip round (60 seconds)
Detail level: Full capability exchange
Cost: Free (direct neighbor communication)
```

This is the most detailed and most frequently updated view. A node knows exactly what its immediate neighbors can offer.

### Ring 1 — 2-3 Hops

```
Scope: Nodes reachable in 2-3 hops
Update frequency: Every few minutes
Detail level: Summarized capabilities, aggregated by type
Example: "There's a WASM node 2 hops away, cost ~X"
```

Capabilities are summarized to reduce gossip bandwidth. Instead of full advertisements, nodes share aggregated summaries: "a storage node with 50 GB available exists 2 hops away at cost Y."

### Ring 2 — Trust Neighborhood

```
Scope: Nodes reachable through the trust graph (friends of friends)
Update frequency: Periodic, via trust-weighted gossip
Detail level: Neighborhood capability summary
Example: "Your neighborhood has 5 gateways, 20 storage nodes"
```

The trust graph provides a natural scope for aggregated capability information. Trusted peers share more detailed information than strangers — this is both efficient (trust = proximity in most cases) and privacy-preserving.

### Ring 3 — Beyond Neighborhood

```
Scope: Nodes beyond the trust graph
Update frequency: On demand (query-based)
Detail level: Coarse hints via Reticulum announces
Example: "A node with GPU compute exists at cost ~X, 8 hops away"
```

Beyond-neighborhood discovery is intentionally coarse and query-driven. The details are resolved when a node actually needs to use a remote capability.

## Bandwidth Efficiency

The ring structure ensures that the most detailed (and most bandwidth-expensive) capability information is only exchanged between direct neighbors, where communication is free. As discovery scope increases, detail decreases proportionally:

```
Ring 0: ~200 bytes per neighbor per round (full capabilities)
Ring 1: ~50 bytes per summary per round (aggregated)
Ring 2: proportional to trust neighborhood size (periodic)
Ring 3: 0 bytes proactive (query-only)
```

On constrained links (< 10 kbps), Rings 2-3 are pull-only — no proactive gossip, only responses to explicit requests. This fits within [Tier 3 of the bandwidth budget](../protocol/network-protocol#bandwidth-budget).

## Discovery Process

When a node needs a capability it doesn't have locally:

1. **Check Ring 0**: Can any direct neighbor provide this?
2. **Check Ring 1**: Are there known providers 2-3 hops away?
3. **Check Ring 2**: Does the trust neighborhood have this capability?
4. **Query Ring 3**: Send a capability query beyond the neighborhood

Most requests resolve at Ring 0 or Ring 1. The further out a query goes, the higher the latency and cost — which naturally incentivizes local provision of common capabilities.

## Mobile Handoff

When a mobile node (phone, laptop, vehicle) moves between areas, its Ring 0 neighbors change. Old relay agreements and payment channels become unreachable. The handoff protocol re-establishes connectivity in the new location.

### Presence Beacons

NEXUS nodes periodically broadcast a lightweight presence beacon on all their interfaces:

```
PresenceBeacon {
    node_id: [u8; 16],       // destination hash
    capabilities: u16,        // bitfield: relay, gateway, storage, compute, etc.
    cost_tier: u8,            // 0=free/trusted, 1=cheap, 2=moderate, 3=expensive
    load: u8,                 // current utilization (0-255)
}
// 20 bytes — broadcast every 10 seconds
```

Beacons are transport-agnostic — they go out over whatever interfaces the node has (LoRa, WiFi, BLE, etc.). A mobile node passively receives beacons to discover local NEXUS nodes before initiating any connection. This is the decentralized equivalent of a cellular tower scan.

### Handoff Sequence

When a mobile node detects new beacons (new area) or loses contact with its current relay:

```
Handoff:
  1. Select best relay from received beacons (lowest cost × load)
  2. Connect and establish link-layer encryption
  3. Open payment channel (both sign initial state)
  4. Resume communication through new relay
```

On high-bandwidth links (WiFi, BLE), this completes in under 500ms. On LoRa, a few seconds.

### Credit-Based Fast Start

For latency-sensitive handoffs (e.g., active voice call), a credit mechanism allows immediate relay before the payment channel is fully established:

```
CreditGrant {
    grantor: NodeID,              // relay
    grantee: NodeID,              // mobile node
    credit_limit_bytes: u32,      // relay allowance before channel required
    valid_for_ms: u16,            // credit window (default: 30 seconds)
    condition: enum {
        VisibleBalance(min_nxs),  // grantee has balance on CRDT ledger
        TrustGraph,               // grantee is in grantor's trust graph
        Unconditional,            // free initial credit (attract users)
    },
}
```

The relay checks the mobile node's balance on the CRDT ledger (already available via gossip) and extends temporary credit. Packets flow immediately while the channel opens in the background.

If the mobile node has no visible balance and no trust relationship, it must complete the channel open first.

### Roaming Cache

Mobile nodes cache relay information for areas they've visited:

```
RoamingEntry {
    area_fingerprint: [u8; 16],  // Blake3 hash of sorted beacon node_ids
    relays: [{
        node_id: NodeID,
        capabilities: u16,
        last_cost_tier: u8,
        last_seen: Timestamp,
        channel: Option<ChannelState>,  // preserved from last visit
    }],
    ttl: Duration,                // expire after 30 days of non-visit
}
```

When a mobile node enters a previously visited area, it recognizes the beacon fingerprint and reconnects to a cached relay. If a preserved `ChannelState` exists and the relay is still alive, the old channel resumes with zero handoff latency — no new negotiation needed.

### Graceful Departure

No explicit teardown:
- Old agreements expire naturally via `valid_until`
- Old payment channels remain valid and settle lazily (next contact, or via gossip)
- The mobile node's trust graph travels with it — if trusted peers exist in the new area, relay is free immediately
