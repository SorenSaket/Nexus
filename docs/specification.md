## Layer Dependency Graph

    L0["Layer 0: Physical Transport<br/>LoRa, WiFi, Cellular, LTE-M, NB-IoT, Ethernet, BLE, Fiber, Serial"]
```

Each layer depends **only** on the layer directly below it. Applications never touch transport details. Payment never touches routing internals.

## Serialization Rules

All Mehr wire formats use the following conventions:

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Byte order** | Little-endian for all multi-byte integers (u16, u32, u64, i64) |
| **Encoding** | Fixed-size binary fields; no self-describing framing (not CBOR, not JSON) |
| **TLV extensions** | Type (u8), Length (u8, max 255), Data (variable). Used in MehrExtension only |
| **Strings** | UTF-8, length-prefixed with u16 (community labels, function IDs) |
| **Hashes** | Raw bytes, no hex encoding on the wire |
| **Signatures** | Raw 64-byte Ed25519 signatures, no ASN.1/DER wrapping |
| **Normalized scores** | Computed on **decoded** values, then divided by the max decoded value in the candidate set. Result is IEEE 754 f32 on nodes that support FP; 16-bit fixed-point (Q0.16, value × 65535) on constrained nodes. Both yield equivalent routing decisions within rounding tolerance |

*The foundation — Reticulum-based transport, cryptographic identity, Kleinberg small-world routing, stochastic relay rewards, CRDT settlement, epoch compaction, emergent trust neighborhoods, and the capability marketplace — is the protocol. Everything above it — storage, compute, pub/sub, naming, and applications — are services built on that foundation.*
