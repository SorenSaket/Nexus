## Layer Dependency Graph

```
Layer 6: Applications
  ├── Messaging, Social, Voice, Naming, Forums, Hosting
  └── depends on ↓

Layer 5: Service Primitives
  ├── NXS-Store, NXS-DHT, NXS-Pub, NXS-Compute
  └── depends on ↓

Layer 4: Capability Marketplace
  ├── Discovery, Agreements, Verification
  └── depends on ↓

Layer 3: Economic Protocol
  ├── NXS Token, Stochastic Rewards, CRDT Ledger, Trust Neighborhoods
  └── depends on ↓

Layer 2: Security
  ├── Link encryption, E2E encryption, Authentication, Key management
  └── depends on ↓

Layer 1: Network Protocol
  ├── Identity, Addressing, Routing, Gossip, Congestion Control
  └── depends on ↓

Layer 0: Physical Transport
  └── LoRa, WiFi, Cellular, Ethernet, BLE, Fiber, Serial
```

Each layer depends **only** on the layer directly below it. Applications never touch transport details. Payment never touches routing internals.

## Version History

| Version | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| v0.1-v0.5 | Superseded | Early design iterations |
| v0.8 | Superseded | Introduced explicit community zones (later replaced by trust neighborhoods) |
| **v1.0** | **Current** | Consolidated specification — Reticulum foundation, stochastic relay rewards, emergent trust neighborhoods |

---

*This specification consolidates design work from v0.1 through v1.0. The foundation — Reticulum-based transport, cryptographic identity, Kleinberg small-world routing, stochastic relay rewards, CRDT settlement, epoch compaction, emergent trust neighborhoods, and the capability marketplace — is the protocol. Everything above it — storage, compute, pub/sub, naming, and applications — are services built on that foundation.*
