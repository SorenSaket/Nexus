# Trust & Neighborhoods

Communities in NEXUS are **emergent, not declared**. There are no admin-created "zones" to join, no governance to negotiate, no artificial boundaries between groups. Instead, communities form naturally from a trust graph — just like in the real world.

## The Trust Graph

Each node maintains a set of trusted peers:

```
TrustConfig {
    // Peers I trust — relay their traffic for free
    trusted_peers: Set<NodeID>,

    // What I charge non-trusted traffic
    default_cost_per_byte: u64,

    // Per-peer cost overrides (discount for friends-of-friends, etc.)
    cost_overrides: Map<NodeID, u64>,

    // Optional self-assigned label (purely informational)
    community_label: Option<String>,    // e.g., "portland-mesh"
}
```

**Adding a trusted peer is the only social action in NEXUS.** Everything else — free local communication, community identity, credit lines — emerges from the trust graph.

## How Communities Emerge

When a cluster of nodes all trust each other, a **neighborhood** forms:

```
  [Alice] ←──trust──→ [Bob] ←──trust──→ [Carol]
     │                  │                   │
     └────trust────→ [Dave] ←───trust──────┘
```

Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave are a neighborhood. No one "created" it. No one "joined" it. It exists because they trust each other.

### Properties

- **No admin**: Nobody runs the neighborhood. It has no keys, no governance, no admission policy.
- **No fragmentation**: The trust graph is continuous. There are no hard boundaries between communities — neighborhoods overlap naturally when people have friends in multiple clusters.
- **No UX burden**: You just mark people as trusted. The same action you'd take when adding a contact.
- **Fully decentralized**: There is nothing to attack, take over, or censor.

## Free Local Communication

Traffic between trusted peers is **always free**. A relay node checks its trust list:

```
Relay decision:
  if sender is trusted AND destination is trusted:
    relay for free (no lottery, no channel update)
  else if sender is trusted:
    relay for free (helping a friend send outbound)
  else:
    relay with stochastic reward lottery
```

Note the asymmetry: a relay helps its trusted peers **send** traffic for free, but does not relay free traffic from strangers just because the destination is trusted. Without this rule, an untrusted node could route unlimited free traffic through you to any of your trusted peers, shifting relay costs onto you without compensation.

This means a village mesh where everyone trusts each other operates with **zero economic overhead** — no tokens, no channels, no settlements. The economic layer only activates for traffic crossing trust boundaries.

## Trust-Based Credit

When a node needs NXS (e.g., to reach beyond its trusted neighborhood), its trusted peers can vouch for it:

```
Transitive credit:
  Direct trust:           full credit line (set by trusting peer)
  Friend-of-friend (2 hops): 10% of direct credit line
  3+ hops of trust:        no credit (too diluted)

  If a credited node defaults, the vouching peer absorbs the debt.
  This makes trust economically meaningful — you only trust people
  you'd lend to.
```

The credit line is **rate-limited** for safety:

| Trust Distance | Max Credit Rate |
|---------------|----------------|
| Direct trusted peer | Configurable by trusting node |
| Friend-of-friend | 10% of direct limit |
| Beyond 2 hops | No transitive credit |

## Community Labels

Nodes can optionally self-assign a `community_label` string:

```
Alice sets:  community_label = "portland-mesh"
Bob sets:    community_label = "portland-mesh"
Carol sets:  community_label = "portland-mesh"
```

This label is:
- **Self-assigned** — no one approves it, no authority enforces uniqueness
- **Not authoritative** — it carries no protocol-level privileges (it cannot grant access, waive fees, or modify trust)
- **Not unique** — multiple disjoint clusters can use the same label
- **Used by services** — [NXS-Name](../applications/naming) scopes human-readable names by label, [NXS-Pub](../services/nxs-pub) supports `Neighborhood(label)` subscriptions, and [NXS-DHT](../services/nxs-dht#neighborhood-scoped-dht) uses labels for content scoping
- **Useful for discovery** — "find nodes labeled 'portland-mesh' near me"

Community labels enable human-readable naming and discovery without any of the governance overhead of explicit zones.

## Comparison: Zones vs. Trust Neighborhoods

| Aspect | Explicit Zones (old) | Trust Neighborhoods (current) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Creation | Someone creates a zone | Emerges from mutual trust |
| Joining | Request + approval | Mark someone as trusted |
| Governance | Admin keys, voting | None needed |
| Boundaries | Hard, declared | Soft, overlapping |
| Free communication | Within zone boundary | Between any trusted peers |
| Naming | `alice@zone-name` | `alice@community-label` |
| Sybil resistance | Admission policy | Trust is social and economic (you absorb their debts) |
| UX complexity | Create, join, configure | Add contacts |

## Sybil Mitigation

The trust graph provides natural Sybil resistance:

1. **Trust has economic cost**: Vouching for a node means absorbing its potential debts. Sybil identities with no real relationships get no credit.
2. **Rate limiting**: Even if a malicious node gains one trust relationship, transitive credit is capped at 10% per hop.
3. **Reputation**: A node's usefulness as a relay/service provider is what earns trust over time. Creating many identities dilutes reputation rather than concentrating it.
4. **Local detection**: A node's trust graph is visible to its peers. A node trusting an unusual number of new, unproven identities is itself suspicious.

## Real-World Parallels

| Real World | NEXUS Trust |
|-----------|------------|
| Talk to your neighbor for free | Free relay between trusted peers |
| Lend money to a friend | Transitive credit via trust |
| Wouldn't lend to a stranger | No credit without trust chain |
| Communities aren't corporations | Neighborhoods have no admin |
| You belong to multiple groups | Trust graph is continuous, not partitioned |
| Reputation builds over time | Trust earned through reliable service |
